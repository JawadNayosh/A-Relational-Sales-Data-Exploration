# A-Relational-Sales-Data-Exploration

In this project, I worked with an open-source sales dataset consisting of two relational tables: 
OrderList and EachOrderBreakdown. The main goal was to analyze customer orders and product-level sales data to uncover 
key business insights. Through data cleaning, I prepared the dataset by standardizing fields, removing duplicates, and 
structuring the data with primary and foreign keys to enable meaningful joins. My analysis aimed to answer questions such as:
Which products or sub-categories drive the most profit? Who are the top customers by sales? What months or segments perform best?
From this, we can recommend strategies like focusing on high-performing product lines, identifying peak sales periods for 
marketing efforts, and targeting loyal customers who place multiple orders. This project demonstrates how relational data and 
thoughtful exploration can lead to actionable business recommendations.

# Insights and Recommendations from Analysis: 
Based on the data analysis, several key insights emerged. Sub-categories like Copiers, Bookcases, and Storage were 
top performers in their respective categories, suggesting these products should be prioritized in marketing and inventory
strategies. The majority of orders came from the Office Supplies category, indicating steady demand in that segment. 
Additionally, customer Angie Massengill generated the highest total sales, highlighting opportunities for loyalty programs
targeting high-value customers. The analysis also showed that customer acquisition was strong in 2014, and repeat customers 
tend to have higher average sales, reinforcing the importance of retention efforts. Overall, the business can benefit by 
focusing on profitable sub-categories, optimizing seasonal sales strategies, and nurturing repeat customer relationships.
